Machine Learning Logos
======================

This repository hosts SVG vector versions of various ML library logos for convenience.

The logos are or may be trademarks of their respective owners.

Aside from the NumPy and Pytorch logos, the logos were hand-vectorized from raster sources with utmost love and caring.

----

Reconstructed by hand from [DL4J.png](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-docs/blob/a4abc5c7a19e89e26d235f92ba0f896e9cde245b/assets/themes/thedocs/img/DL4J.png).

Color from [logo.png](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-docs/blob/a4abc5c7a19e89e26d235f92ba0f896e9cde245b/images/logo.png).

OpenVINO Toolkit
----------------

openvino-toolkit.svg is based on the logotype, as on [the site](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit?),
set in Intel Clear Pro using Intel blue (#0071c5).

openvino-2.svg is based on [this logo](https://01.org/sites/default/files/openvino-square.png). The text is set in Montreal Medium, which is not exactly the same, but very close.


ImageNet
--------

Based on [the official logo](http://image-net.org/index_files/logo.jpg).

Set in slightly fattened (using stroke width) Myriad Pro Regular.

The fattening caused minor artifacts around the corners of glyphs, but it doesn't look too bad.
